<p> Sunny used to be a small girl who lived in the village. She loved going to thegarden everyday, until one day her mom kcicked her out of the garden, not wanted her to go back there. A flood came right after and brought sunny to tears. After months of being deprived from the garden and watching it flood, she had enough. She went to the garden on a windy night; she ending up drowing in the flood. Now, sunny stands in the city, and every year after the flood everyone in the city goes and praises her. for some reason after the flood, sunny and the garden are the only things that stay standin, and for that they thank sunny after every flood. </p>
