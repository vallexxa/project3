<p> Anastasia is 23 years old, in college who recently moved to San Francisco, to study in medicine. When Anastasia was three years old her mom died in a car accident while she was in the car. Her father could not look at Ana without thinking of his wife, so eventually he stopped talking to her. Not having her father around and by her in a greiving process, cvaused to her to feel worthless and as if she didn't mean much. She ran awy from home, taking nothing but a duffel bag full of things that could fit. Through the weeks of her on the streets, so looked for an ophanage, foster homes, anything that would take her in, but time was running out and she was getting helpless.

She tried grabbing onto the railing, instead missing it and falling down to the floor.

"No don't give me that face, what the hell happened? I took you r stupid pill and now my headache is worse and I can't think straight. It's like people are talking and they won't shut up!" She yelled.
"look don't freak out but it was one of the project I was working on with... with a company and you weren't supposed to take it." Ana goes wided eyes "What??!!" Jeremey explained what the pill was. The blue crystal pill that she took was
